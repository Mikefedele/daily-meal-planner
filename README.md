# daily-meal-planner

## Description

For this app, my group and I wanted to build something that would help generate meal ideas.  You can input the meal of the day, breakfast, lunch, or dinner, then select a protein choice and the amount of calories you want for that meal and it will generate meal ideas for you.  There is a text field for you to write a shopping list.  Then on the last page you can input your address or zip code and it will generate local grocery stores you can shop at.  When you select a store the mapquest api will give you a map with directions on how to get to the store you selected.
